                <h4>SMALL THOUGHTS IN BIG BRAINS</h4>
                <p><i>Small Thoughts In Big Brains</i> is a comic book made as my final project for my degree, completed in 2014. <i>Small Thoughts In Big Brains</i> is an adaptation of a radio story from the radio show THIS AMERICAN LIFE. The project was a culmination of a semester of work, with the project undergoing multiple iterations until the final piece was produced. The comic features ink illustrations drawn with a brush. It is fully coloured, with three colours for three anecdotes.
The book is perfect bound with colour print on a custom paper stock.</p>

                <p>The challenge of this project was how to translate a radio story, that is, a story with no visual aspect into a printed comic book. The key to this translation was to be less literal and more graphic. Instead of just showing the story word for word, it was in fact easier to create visual metaphors for changing narrators and referring to different parts of narrators lives. Doors were used in the story to represent moving from voice to voice, and move from time period to time period. The panel below shows a first draft next to the final version.</p>
