                <h4>FIFTH SPHERE EXPANSION</h4>
                <p>Fifth Sphere Expansion is a Warhammer 40000 Battle Report. A Battle Report is a turn-by-turn recount of battles of Warhammer 40000, a tabletop war game played by two or more players. This zine was created in the same format in the game's monthly publication, which includes miniature photography, turn-by-turn illustrated maps and formatted army lists.</p>
                <p>See the full zine <a class="imgurLink" href="https://imgur.com/a/X1EpA" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <p>The process of putting together a battle report involves many steps. After assembling and painting the miniatures, a game will be played betwen two players. Players can play the game with a unique angle, be it competitive or in this case, narrative. Players imagined this was an epic battle taking place in the Warhammer 40000 universe. The battle was documented turn by turn with photos and recording notable actions and key moments in the game. Players also gave insight into the composition of their armies, and thoughts before and after the game.</p>

                <p>The project involved miniature photography, with a DIY home set up. Challenges included photographing a black and white miniature, and diffusing lights for softer shadows.</p>
